STATA notes from PJS:
====================
[29 Nov 2018]:
	+ add water haul identification to the preparation of the Triennial survey data
[29 Nov 2016]:
	+ fix bug with log files: add 'cap log close' before every invocation of a log file
[21 Nov 2016]:
	+ change default doorspread for the two shrimp surveys to 29.6 m
[28 Aug 2016]:
	+ add trap to processing WCVI shrimp survey to catch situations when the depth fields for trip=67647  haven't been properly updated
	+ change logic on 'attendflag', 'useflag', and 'savefile': all optionally off now
	+ generalise the collapse for multiple observations per tow to include the shrimp surveys
[03 & 05 Sep 2015]:
	+ add code to <getlabels> subroutine which replaces -1 with '.' (missing).  
	+ needed to add -1 to the ACCESS output files due to limitations in converting from the decimal' numeric type in queries
	+ also change the default <datemask> option to "dmy" to conform to export specifications in ACCESS
	+ add code to force dropping of 2014 WCHG survey data (survey not completed and too deficient to use)
	+ add option to allow dropping of pre-2003 shrimp survey data (convention adopted in GF Section)
[28 Oct 2013]: 
	+ add code to check for and process situations where there is more than one record per tow
	+ drop hardwired rescaling of 2010 WCVI synoptic distance-travelled field (no longer needed)
[20 Oct 2013]:
	+ NOTE TO PJS: consider switching doorspread replacement to use ONLY tows that are valid
	+ (ie: use==1|use==2|use==6, etc....)
	+ also add ARCTIC OCEAN to the vessel list
[22 Aug 2013]:
	+ add 'depstrat' variable to QCSoundSynoptic survey//hardwire call to $stratumlabelfile 
[17&18 Aug 2013]:
	+ add Nordic Pearl to vessel list//identify strata to drop in the NMFS Triennial survey
	+ (instead of within gfsurvey.ado) with 'missing' (consistent with the Canadian surveys)
[16 Nov 2012]:
	+ fix bug in getlabelends subroutine (needed to shave off front end of QCSndSyn labels)
	+ also some residual bugs in the two shrimp survey routines in calling the getlabels subroutine (did not save $stratumlabelfile for these two surveys)
[10 Sep 2012]:
	+ change to a `defaultdoorspread' option instead of 61.6 from Yamanaka et al. 1996
[08 Sep 2012]:
	+ added code to tidy up analysis of historical WCQCI surveys
[29 Aug/01 Sep 2012]: 
	+ add historical WCQCI trips (survey_code=15) & 1997 Ocean Selector (survey_code=16)
	+ add restratification subroutine and apply to 2006 WCQCI synoptic survey (as well as surveys 15 & 16)
	+ also changed logic for stratum label file: now a temporary file that doesn't need erasing
[05 Aug 2012]: 
	+ add GBReed_historic (emphasis on WCVI surveys) (survey_code=14)
[24-30 July 2012]:
	+ add mask option to code (need to deal with change to "ymd" from "dmy")
	+ add Caledonian 1996 survey to code (survey code=13)
	+ add traps to find out-of-range depth and distance information for synoptic surveys only
[02 Apr 2011]:
	+ add line of code to exclude 19 target strength acoustic tows in Ocean Selector 1994 GIG survey (survey codes 8 & 11);
	+ seems that it doesn't matter which code we use to prepare this survey (get the same result as long as stratum==1)
[17 Jan 2011]:
	+ add compulsory log file 
[14 Dec 2010]:
	+ add generic GIG stratum code to survey==11//this is now the survey code to use when analysing this survey series
[19 July 2010]:
	+ minor bug fixes (none serious)
[12 Dec 2009]:
	+ 3. survey #8 is now the full GIG retrospective (=survey_series 32);
	  - this is for the 464 tows identified by moi between latitudes 50.9 and 51.6;
	  - it includes the 1967 to 1984 GB Reed surveys, plus the 1984 Eastward Ho, the 1994 & 1995 Ocean Selector and the 1995 Frosti;
	  - this survey will use the Norm Olsen grouping codes
	+ 4. survey #11 will remain the full series (1601 tows for survey_series 21);
	  - includes all tows from 1965 to 2005, going from the GB Reed to the Viking Storm;
	  - this will also include Mitchell Gully tows, the discarded Southward Ho 1979 survey, and the same surveys as #8;
	  - the difference is that I will create my own stratification for these surveys
	+ 5. added survey #12 to accommodate survey_series_ID=33;
	  - this is only for the two 1995 Ocean Selector and Frosti surveys so that they can use the same grouping codes as the QC Sound synoptic survey (survey#2 in this software)
	+ 6. decided that I will reserve all remaining codes from #13 to #19 to WC GF surveys;
	  - any additional surveys from other areas that will use this software will be given codes beginning at #20
[26 Nov 2009]
	+ 1. reserve a survey code for the hecate st synoptic survey which I will start using next year
	+ 2. add option to GB Reed prep to process other vessels (GIG retrospective) (updated 02 Dec 2009) 
[05 Sep 2009]
	+ modify getweight subroutine so I can find records where there is a valid species code but no data
[18-20 Dec 2008]
	+ changed the approach to data prep to conform to what Norm Olsen is doing, based on a phone call this AM;
	+ for calculating distance travelled for a survey tow, he uses the following order of calculation:
		- #1: use FE_distance_travelled as default (Norm says that he and Kate have groomed the data to ensure this was reliable and based on vessel tracks)
		- #2: use bottom_contact*speed
		- #3: use winch_time*speed
	+ Norm also uses default speed and doorspreads that are year and survey specific (not stratum specific as I do)
[10 & 18 Nov 2008]
	+ add west coast QCI synoptic survey to this program (survey==9)
[09 Nov 2008]
	+ added code to check for missing weight data when there are numbers caught (and sub with mean weight by year)
	+ note: this option has been disabled at the suggestion of Norm Olsen (see getweight subroutine)
[02 Nov 2008]
	+ hardwired time series so that only GB Reed survey trips are included in the gfsurvey file
[31 Oct 2008]
	+ consolidated some code and updated program to fit revised GFBioCatEff.mdb; also fixed exit codes
[08 July 2008]
	+ minor fixes to the triennial survey code (re lats and longs)
[08 Nov 2007]
	+ add depint variable to GB Reed surveys
[31 Aug 2007]
	+ add historical GB Reed surveys
[09 Aug 2007]
	+ add capacity to process dates
/* [06 August 2007]
	+ generic program to prepare survey data: all in one complex file
	+ use an integer code to designate the survey:
		1: old Hecate St Survey (note: this program does not prepare the recruited biomass estimate as done for ENL in 2006)
		2: QC Sound Synoptic
		3: WCVI Synoptic
		4: WCVI Shrimp
		5: Triennial
		6: Pcod Monitoring
		7: QCSound Shrimp
		8: historical GB Reed survey (now includes 1984 Eastward Ho and 1990s Ocean Selector and Frosti - use this for biomass ests)
		9: WCQCI Synoptic (added Nov 2008)
		10: Hecate St synoptic survey (added July 2010)
		11: retrospective GIG (includes GB Reed and misc GIG surveys) (added Nov 2009 - not for biomass)
		12: retrospective GIG (1995 Ocean Selector and Frosti only - QC Snd synoptic stratification) (added Dec 2009)
