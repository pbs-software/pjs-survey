**PJSsurvey** provides an R interface for algorithms developed by Paul J. Starr in Stata, a general-purpose statistical software package. The conversion occurred in 2019, with few updates since. Contact <a href="mailto:paul@starrfish.net">Paul Starr</a> for updates.

<font color="red"><h3>Brief History of Stata</h3></font>

Stata is a general-purpose statistical software package developed by StataCorp for data manipulation, visualization, statistics, and automated reporting. It is used by researchers in many fields, including biomedicine, economics, epidemiology, and sociology.

Stata was initially developed by Computing Resource Center in California and the first version was released in 1985. In 1993, the company moved to College Station, Texas and was renamed Stata Corporation, now known as StataCorp. A major release in 2003 included a new graphics system and dialogue boxes for all commands. Since then, a new version has been released once every two years. The current version is Stata 18, released in April 2023,

<font color="red"><h3>Installation</h3></font>

Although **PJSsurvey** is not available on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a> (Comprehensive R Archive Network), the source code appears on <a href="https://github.com/pbs-software/pjs-survey">GitHub</a> and can be built in R using:

`devtools::install_github("pbs-software/pjs-survey/PBSsurvey")`

Most of the time, the source code has been checked using CRAN's `R CMD check --as-cran` routine using a recent R-devel installation on a **Windows 11** 64-bit system.
